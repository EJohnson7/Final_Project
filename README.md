# Final_Project
Restaurant Visitors in Japan 
This is a group project that I completed by partnering with team members to assess and analyze restaurant data and machine learning to make forecasting predictions for inventory and restaurant entrepreneurship.


I was responsible for Importing, data wrangling, cleaning, website building and Tableau Data Analysis. I used Python, Jupyter Notebooks, JavaScript, and Tableau.
